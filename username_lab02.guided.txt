I had a couple of issues making sure I had completed this guided lab correctly.
One of the issues I had was making sure that I had correctly inputted the right
color, another was copying a file and moving it at the same time. It took me a
couple of tries, but I believe in the process, I learned alot more than I would
have otherwise.
